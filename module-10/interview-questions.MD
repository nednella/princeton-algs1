## Red-black BST with no extra memory

Describe how to save the memory for storing the colour information when implementing a red-black BST.

**_Hint:_** modify the structure of the BST to encode the colour information.

## Document search

Design an algorithm that takes a sequence of n document words and a sequence of m query words, and find the shortest interval in which the m query words appear in the document in the order given. The length of an interval is the number of words in that interval.

**_Hint:_** for each word, maintain a sorted list of the indices in the document in which that word appears. Scan through the sorted lists of the query word in a judicious manner.

```

```

## Generalised queue

Design a generalised queue data type that supports all of the following operations in logarithmic time or better in the worst case.

-   Create an empty data structure.
-   Append an item to the end of the queue.
-   Remove an item from the front of the queue.
-   Return the i'th item in the queue.
-   Remove the i'th item from the queue.

**_Hint:_** create a red-black BST where the keys are integers and the values are the items such that the i'th largest key in the red-black BST corresponds to the i'th item.
