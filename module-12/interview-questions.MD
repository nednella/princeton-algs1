## 4-SUM

Given an array a[] of n integers, the 4-SUM problem is to determine if there exists distinct indices i, j, k and l, such that a[i] + a[j] = a[k] + a[l]. Design an algorithm for the 4-SUM problem that takes time proportional to n^2 (under suitable technical assumptions).

**_Hint:_** create a hash table with (n | 2) key-value pairs.

## Hashing with wrong hashCode() or equals()

Suppose that you implement a data type OlympicAthlete for use in java.util.HashMap.

-   Describe what happens if you override hashCode() but not equals()
-   Describe what happens if you override equals() but not hashCode()
-   Describe what happens if you override hashCode() but implement public boolean equals(OlympicAthlete that), instead of public boolean equals(Object that)

**_Hint:_** try it and see.
