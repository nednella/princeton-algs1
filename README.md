## Princeton Algorithms 1

Repository for the workings of the Princeton Algorithms 1 course available via Coursera.

### Assignment Scores

-   Percolation = 94/100
-   Queues = 100/100
-   Collinear Points = 98/100
-   8 Puzzle = 100/100
-   K-d Tree = 100/100

### Notes

-   Percolation missing 6 marks due to lack of backwash prevention
-   Collinear points missing 2 marks due to 5 failed timing tests (2c-2g), probably due to poor implementation of segment generation in **FastCollinearPoints.findSegments()** method
