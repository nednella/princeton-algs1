## Dynamic median

Design a data type that supports **_insert_** in logarithmic time, **_find-the-median_** in constant time, and **_remove-the-median_** in logarithmic time. If the number of keys in the data type is even, find/remove the **_lower median_**.

## Randomised priority queue

Describe how to add the methods **_sample()_** and **_delRandom()_** to our binary heap implementation. The two methods return a key that is chosen uniformly at random among the remaining keys, with the latter method also removing that key. the **_sample()_** method should take constant time; the **_delRandom()_** key should take logarithmic time. Do not worry about resizing the underlying array.

## Taxicab numbers

A **_taxicab_** number is an integer that can be expressed as the sum of two cubes of positive intergers in two different ways: **a^3 + b^3 = c^3 + d^3**. For example, **1729** is the smallest taxicab number: **9^3 + 10^3 = 1^3 + 12^3**. Design an algorithm to find all taxicab numbers with **_a, b, c_** and **_d_** less than **_n_**.

-   Version 1: use time proportional to **_n^2 log n_** and space proprotional to **_n^2_**
-   Version 2: use time proportional to **_n^2 log n_** and space proprotional to **_n_**
