## Queue with stacks

Implement a queue with two stacks so that each queue operation takes a constant amortized number of stack operations.

**_Hint:_** if the push elements onto a stack and then pop them all - they appear in reverse order. Repeat the process to get them back in order.

```

```

## Stack with max

Create a data structure that efficiently supports the stack operations (push and pop), and also a return-the-maximum operation. Assume the elements are real numbers so that you can compare them.

**_Hint:_** Use two stacks, one to store all of the items and a second stack to store the maximum.

```

```

## Java generics

Explain why Java prohibits generic array creation.

**_Hint:_** To start, you need to understand that Java arrays are covariant, but Java generics are not. String[] is a subtype of Object[], but Stack<String> is not a subtype of Stack<Object>.

```
